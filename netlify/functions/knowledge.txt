# Disciple and Discipleship
- A disciple is a friend and follower of Jesus, being trained and empowered by him to love
- Discipleship is training myself and others to be trained by Christ
- Jesus' call: Luke 9:23: "Deny yourself, take up your cross every day, and follow me."
- Self-denial involves surrender. I surrender ALL: Surrender A - Actual L - Lived L - Life, not perfection. Examine real life with all of its struggles. Question: Is the way of Jesus becoming more real? Small progress counts. Grace makes growth possible.
- Discipleship in two decisions: 1. Your first decision to follow Jesus and 2. Every next decision to follow Jesus
- Community is essential for discipleship. Cannot be formed in isolation. Community is received from God, includes different viewpoints and maturity. Everyone submitting to Jesus


# Knowing and Belonging
- We belong together, and together with God (1 John 1:1-4)
- Centered on Jesus for formation, bound to one another. Caring, encouraging, serving, etc. Moving toward Jesus together. Belonging brings formation
- Favor I-You (I-Thou) over I-It interactions. Knowing God is more than knowing about God. Try to view objects as subjects.
- We love in order to know. Knowing requires trust, regard, invitation, response
- Knowing requires context: Always pay attention. Everything has context. Pay attention to circumstances, background, perspective. Context matters for scripture, history, culture. Missing context means missing what God is doing.
- Knowing requires authenticity: Always pursue truth. See and relate according to who God created us to be. We're image bearers, being formed into Christ's image.
- Knowing requires relationship: Always see the person. Connections exchange God's love. People more valuable than issues. Relationship required for knowing well.
- Knowing requires a discovery posture: Always think next step. Curiosity. Willingness to trust and know God more. Requires curiosity, implies uncertainty. Leads others on faith journey.

## Parable of the Sower (Matthew 13:19-23)
- Notice and understand (Matthew 13:19). Hears but doesn't understand. Enemy wants to steal message. Need humility, curiosity, openness.
- Take root and grow deep (Matthew 13:20-21). Receives with joy but no depth. Falls away in trouble. Need patience, basics, baptism, community connection.
- Don't let faith get strangled (Matthew 13:22). Understands with some depth but worldly distractions choke faith. Need wholehearted commitment, avoid distractions, learn with others.
- Be fruitful (Matthew 13:23). Understands, has depth, bears fruit helping others. Needs support, focus on God not results, humility and accountability.

## Change process: Encounter → Formation → Expression
- Encounters drive formation and expression. To change behavior, change encounters.
- We cannot fully control encounters, but we can place ourselves in situations where we are more likely to experience God-encounters

## Biblical Foundations
Relational Knowing in Scripture:
- Yadah: intimate knowledge (Adam "knew" Eve)—covenant intimacy, not information
- Emet (truth): faithfulness/reliability, not just facts
- Wisdom needs "fear of LORD"—right relationship
- Jesus IS truth (John 14:6)—personal, not just propositional
- "If anyone loves God, he is known by God" (1 Cor 8:3)—love enables knowing

## Knowing Together:
- Individual knowing embedded in community
- Need others to calibrate perception, confirm insights, challenge blindspots
- Tradition = community's accumulated wisdom
- Testimony essential — we know through trusting others' witness

## Belonging Practices:
- Attentive Presence: sustained, loving attention
- Wondering Well: curiosity over cynicism
- Testimony Exchange: share and trust what God shows
- Pattern Recognition: notice connections, God's fingerprints
- Pledge and Response: commit to what you're knowing; act on it

## Practical Application
Living as Christians:
- Encounter God in Scripture, not just extract information
- Approach others as subjects to know, not objects to analyze
- Accept partial knowing requires humility
- Knowing God obligates us to live accordingly
- Expect transformation—genuine knowing changes knower
