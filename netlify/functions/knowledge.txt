# Disciple and Discipleship
- A disciple is a friend and follower of Jesus, being trained and empowered by him to love
- Discipleship is training myself and others to be trained by Christ
- Jesus' call: Luke 9:23: "Deny yourself, take up your cross every day, and follow me."
- Self-denial involves surrender. I surrender ALL: Surrender A - Actual L - Lived L - Life, not perfection. Examine real life with all of its struggles. Question: Is the way of Jesus becoming more real? Small progress counts. Grace makes growth possible.
- Discipleship in two decisions: 1. Your first decision to follow Jesus and 2. Every next decision to follow Jesus
- Community is essential for discipleship. Cannot be formed in isolation. Community is received from God, includes different viewpoints and maturity. Everyone submitting to Jesus


# Knowing and Belonging
- We belong together, and together with God (1 John 1:1-4)
- Centered on Jesus for formation, bound to one another. Caring, encouraging, serving, etc. Moving toward Jesus together. Belonging brings formation
- Favor I-You (I-Thou) over I-It interactions. Knowing God is more than knowing about God. Try to view objects as subjects.
- We love in order to know. Knowing requires trust, regard, invitation, response
- Knowing requires context: Always pay attention. Everything has context. Pay attention to circumstances, background, perspective. Context matters for scripture, history, culture. Missing context means missing what God is doing.
- Knowing requires authenticity: Always pursue truth. See and relate according to who God created us to be. We're image bearers, being formed into Christ's image.
- Knowing requires relationship: Always see the person. Connections exchange God's love. People more valuable than issues. Relationship required for knowing well.
- Knowing requires a discovery posture: Always think next step. Curiosity. Willingness to trust and know God more. Requires curiosity, implies uncertainty. Leads others on faith journey.

## Hesed: The Hebrew word hesed describes the relational texture of knowing God and being known by him—eternal life. It covers steadfast love, loyal kindness, and covenant faithfulness.

## Parable of the Sower (Matthew 13:19-23)
- Notice and understand (Matthew 13:19). Hears but doesn't understand. Enemy wants to steal message. Need humility, curiosity, openness.
- Take root and grow deep (Matthew 13:20-21). Receives with joy but no depth. Falls away in trouble. Need patience, basics, baptism, community connection.
- Don't let faith get strangled (Matthew 13:22). Understands with some depth but worldly distractions choke faith. Need wholehearted commitment, avoid distractions, learn with others.
- Be fruitful (Matthew 13:23). Understands, has depth, bears fruit helping others. Needs support, focus on God not results, humility and accountability.

## Change process: Encounter → Formation → Expression
- Encounters drive formation and expression. To change behavior, change encounters.
- We cannot fully control encounters, but we can place ourselves in situations where we are more likely to experience God-encounters

## Biblical Foundations
Relational Knowing in Scripture:
- Yadah: intimate knowledge (Adam "knew" Eve)—covenant intimacy, not information
- Emet (truth): faithfulness/reliability, not just facts
- Wisdom needs "fear of LORD"—right relationship
- Jesus IS truth (John 14:6)—personal, not just propositional
- "If anyone loves God, he is known by God" (1 Cor 8:3)—love enables knowing

## Knowing Together:
- Individual knowing embedded in community
- Need others to calibrate perception, confirm insights, challenge blindspots
- Tradition = community's accumulated wisdom
- Testimony essential — we know through trusting others' witness

## Belonging Practices:
- Attentive Presence: sustained, loving attention
- Wondering Well: curiosity over cynicism
- Testimony Exchange: share and trust what God shows
- Pattern Recognition: notice connections, God's fingerprints
- Pledge and Response: commit to what you're knowing; act on it

## Practical Application
Living as Christians:
- Encounter God in Scripture, not just extract information
- Approach others as subjects to know, not objects to analyze
- Accept partial knowing requires humility
- Knowing God obligates us to live accordingly
- Expect transformation—genuine knowing changes knower


# Christian Character and Postures

## Holiness (hagios)
Called out, set apart, different. Rescued from darkness into God's kingdom. New identity, citizenship, family, culture. Sanctification makes kingdom life natural. Christians as exiles: in world but not of it, ambassadors not controllers.

## Community (koinonia)
Relating to each other. Koinonia = deep fellowship. Cannot be whole alone - need unity. One body, family, bride. Differences make unity miraculous. All differences less important than Jesus.

## Purpose (agape)
Love God and others. Agape = self-sacrificing love. Love through actions, even to enemies. Influence like salt, light, yeast, fragrance. A subtle, patient, pressure. Honor freedom, serve others, work for their good. The only thing that matters is faith working through love. (Galatians 5:6)

## Identity
Identity received from God. He knew and formed us (Jer 1:5, Ps 139). Don't let world define you. Discover true self, jettison false self.

## Called out, sent back: Called out from world patterns, adopt kingdom patterns, sent back to love world. Work shrewdly and patiently. A patient pressure on the world's systems.

## Humility: God is great. God is good. And God is near.
    - Trust God's character: all-powerful, all-knowing, eternal, good, close, providing. Respond with reverence, wonder, awe.
    - If God created Life, then He alone gets to define it
    - Understanding is "standing under"
    
## Responsibility: We are faithful stewards of the many forms of God's grace.
    - Handle God's gifts well: life, abilities, resources, relationships, forgiveness. Managers not owners.

## Sanctification: People like us do things like this; as God's treasured possession, we life Jesus-like lives
    - Live in God-given identity and kingdom culture. Moved from darkness to kingdom. New identity: holy, beloved, forgiven. New culture: kingdom patterns.

## Imitation: We so love the world that we give our first and our best.
    - Love as God loves (John 3:16). Love enemies and difficult people. Give sacrificially.
    
## Influence: Our everyday story is for God's glory.
    -Daily life reveals God. Ambassadors everywhere: church, home, work, community. Work for others' welfare. Influence through prayer, authenticity, generosity, peace. A subtle, patient, pressure.
    
## Fill everything in every way: This phrase from Ephesians 1:23 describes Christ's comprehensive presence and authority. By the Holy Spirit and through his Church, Jesus works to fill all creation⏤every place, person, and moment⏤with his life, love, and lordship. This directs our presence and work in the world.

## In God's name: When we baptize in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, we're immersing someone into God's nature and character⏤his very essence. When we pray or act in God's name, we bear God's reputation. It's not just using his title, but seeing ourselves under his authority, in his family, wrapped in his identity and protection. To do otherwise is to take his name in vain.

## Childlike faith: trust without pretense⏤coming to God with open hands, honest questions, and unguarded wonder. It's knowing God relationally and believing he is who he says he is, receiving his love without earning it, and depending on him like a child depends on a parent.

## Love the world?: Are we to love the world? If ‘the world’ means neighbors, then yes! If ‘the world’ means God’s creation, also yes! If ‘the world’ means systems and patterns opposed to God, no! We love people who haven’t yet found freedom in Christ. We lovingly accept our caretaking role over creation. But we reject worldly ways that exalt the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life.

## Familiarity and Fluency: Christians understand the world's patterns (power, wealth, self-interest) without adopting them. Meanwhile, we become fluent in Kingdom culture: faith working through love, self-giving service, enemy-love, and trust in God's provision. Over time, Kingdom ways should feel more natural than worldly ones, and we engage the world as wise, yet harmless, Kingdom ambassadors.

## On earth as in heaven: God's will is for his ways to be lived on earth as it is in heaven. This will happen as his people are sanctified⏤set apart and transformed⏤and live lives marked by gratitude. In our holy living and thankfulness, we become instruments of heaven's culture breaking into the present world.

## Dignity: Every person bears God's image⏤the imago Dei⏤an unsurpassable, equal dignity. Dehumanization denies this truth, treating people as less than imagebearers. Christ restores dignity by affirming our worth, reconciling us to God, and calling us to honor all people, even enemies, as beloved beings deserving respect and compassion.

## Reconciliation: Reconciliation is restoring broken relationships. Christ's death and resurrection made reconciliation with God possible by removing our sin. The Church continues this ministry, working to heal divisions across boundaries that corrupt relationships with God, self, others, and creation.


# Key Definitions

## Eternal Life: Eternal life is knowing relationally the Father and the Son (John 17:3)

## Faith: Trust that's able to take a step. We have pledged ourselves to the One we are coming to know (able by the Holy Spirit and God's grace) Take the step! Faith consists of three parts: 1. Trust 2. Agency. 3. Thresholds. Faith sits on the near side of a threshold. A step of faith moves us to the other side of the threshold: from known into not-yet-known. It is an upward spiral. 

## Love: Love is the gift of self. Gift of obedience to God and for another's flourishing.

## Formation: Relationally embedding heaven's culture in disciple and church so it becomes normal pattern.

## Leadership: Work of compelling love from pure heart, good conscience, authentic faith by teaching and example (1 Tim 1:5).

## Justice: Righteousness. Making things right, working for shalom (right relationships). Includes rectification, restoration, reconciliation, renewal.

## Worship: A holistic self-giving response to glory. (Rom 12:1). Hint: Creator and created things have glory. Glory is the pure expression of a 'Thing's' intended being.

## Grace: The unmerited God-given desire, ability, and resources to participate in the Father's economy (purpose, plan, and activity) as His beloved.

## Devotion: A way of life in which we bring our whole selves to God and to others.

## Salvation: Jesus provided our rescue. When we trust Jesus, we are resettled in a new kingdom⏤God's kingdom. It's like emigrating to a new country, being reborn, or being adopted into a new family. We receive a new identity, citizenship, culture, and belonging. Everything becomes new.

## Authenticity and Transparency: Authenticity is being exactly what something is supposed to be. We are imagebearers of God, citizens of God's kingdom⏤Christ's body. Authenticity is carrying these identities accurately. It's different from transparency, which is honest disclosure of something authentic or inauthentic.

## Fear and Reverence: Biblical fear isn't dread but awe-struck wonder before God's holiness, power, and goodness. It's recognizing who God truly is⏤Creator, Judge, Redeemer⏤and responding with humility, worship, and obedience. Reverence flows from knowing God is both infinitely great and intimately near, deserving our highest honor and deepest trust.

## Culture: Culture is the shared patterns, practices, stories, and values that shape how a group of people (e.g., God's people, Port City people) see the world and live together. It's "the way we do things around here"⏤the assumptions, habits, and rhythms that become normal over time, forming a community's identity and direction.
