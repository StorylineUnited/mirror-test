# Disciple and Discipleship
- A disciple is a friend and follower of Jesus, being trained and empowered by him to love
- Discipleship is training myself and others to be trained by Christ
- Jesus' call: Luke 9:23: "Deny yourself, take up your cross every day, and follow me."
- Self-denial involves surrender. I surrender ALL: Surrender A - Actual L - Lived L - Life, not perfection. Examine real life with all of its struggles. Question: Is the way of Jesus becoming more real? Small progress counts. Grace makes growth possible.
- Discipleship in two decisions: 1. Your first decision to follow Jesus and 2. Every next decision to follow Jesus
- Community is essential for discipleship. Cannot be formed in isolation. Community is received from God, includes different viewpoints and maturity. Everyone submitting to Jesus


# Knowing and Belonging
- We belong together, and together with God (1 John 1:1-4)
- Centered on Jesus for formation, bound to one another. Caring, encouraging, serving, etc. Moving toward Jesus together. Belonging brings formation
- Favor I-You (I-Thou) over I-It interactions. Knowing God is more than knowing about God. Try to view objects as subjects.
- We love in order to know. Knowing requires trust, regard, invitation, response
- Knowing requires context: Always pay attention. Everything has context. Pay attention to circumstances, background, perspective. Context matters for scripture, history, culture. Missing context means missing what God is doing.
- Knowing requires authenticity: Always pursue truth. See and relate according to who God created us to be. We're image bearers, being formed into Christ's image.
- Knowing requires relationship: Always see the person. Connections exchange God's love. People more valuable than issues. Relationship required for knowing well.
- Knowing requires a discovery posture: Always think next step. Curiosity. Willingness to trust and know God more. Requires curiosity, implies uncertainty. Leads others on faith journey.

## Hesed: The Hebrew word hesed describes the relational texture of knowing God and being known by him—eternal life. It covers steadfast love, loyal kindness, and covenant faithfulness.

## Shalom: Comprehensive, dynamic wholeness — the flourishing of all things in right relationship with God, self, others, and creation. 

## Caritas: Selfless, rightly-ordered love rooted in divine grace—directed first toward God, then neighbor and self. Contrasted with cupiditas (disordered self-love). Foundation of all virtue and right relationship (Augustine; 1 Jn 4:19).

## Parable of the Sower (Matthew 13:19-23)
- Notice and understand (Matthew 13:19). Hears but doesn't understand. Enemy wants to steal message. Need humility, curiosity, openness.
- Take root and grow deep (Matthew 13:20-21). Receives with joy but no depth. Falls away in trouble. Need patience, basics, baptism, community connection.
- Don't let faith get strangled (Matthew 13:22). Understands with some depth but worldly distractions choke faith. Need wholehearted commitment, avoid distractions, learn with others.
- Be fruitful (Matthew 13:23). Understands, has depth, bears fruit helping others. Needs support, focus on God not results, humility and accountability.

## Change process: Encounter → Formation → Expression
- Encounters drive formation and expression. To change behavior, change encounters.
- We cannot fully control encounters, but we can place ourselves in situations where we are more likely to experience God-encounters

## Biblical Foundations
Relational Knowing in Scripture:
- Yadah: intimate knowledge (Adam "knew" Eve)—covenant intimacy, not information
- Emet (truth): faithfulness/reliability, not just facts
- Wisdom needs "fear of LORD"—right relationship
- Jesus IS truth (John 14:6)—personal, not just propositional
- "If anyone loves God, he is known by God" (1 Cor 8:3)—love enables knowing

## Knowing Together:
- Individual knowing embedded in community
- Need others to calibrate perception, confirm insights, challenge blindspots
- Tradition = community's accumulated wisdom
- Testimony essential — we know through trusting others' witness

## Belonging Practices:
- Attentive Presence: sustained, loving attention
- Wondering Well: curiosity over cynicism
- Testimony Exchange: share and trust what God shows
- Pattern Recognition: notice connections, God's fingerprints
- Pledge and Response: commit to what you're knowing; act on it

## Practical Application
Living as Christians:
- Encounter God in Scripture, not just extract information
- Approach others as subjects to know, not objects to analyze
- Accept partial knowing requires humility
- Knowing God obligates us to live accordingly
- Expect transformation—genuine knowing changes knower


# Christian Character and Postures

## Holiness (hagios)
Called out, set apart, different. Rescued from darkness into God's kingdom. New identity, citizenship, family, culture. Sanctification makes kingdom life natural. Christians as exiles: in world but not of it, ambassadors not controllers.

## Community (koinonia)
Relating to each other. Koinonia = deep fellowship. Cannot be whole alone - need unity. One body, family, bride. Differences make unity miraculous. All differences less important than Jesus.

## Purpose (agape)
Love God and others. Agape = self-sacrificing love. Love through actions, even to enemies. Influence like salt, light, yeast, fragrance. A subtle, patient, pressure. Honor freedom, serve others, work for their good. The only thing that matters is faith working through love. (Galatians 5:6)

## Identity
Identity received from God. He knew and formed us (Jer 1:5, Ps 139). Don't let world define you. Discover true self, jettison false self.

## Called out, sent back: Called out from world patterns, adopt kingdom patterns, sent back to love world. Work shrewdly and patiently. A patient pressure on the world's systems.

## Humility: God is great. God is good. And God is near.
    - Trust God's character: all-powerful, all-knowing, eternal, good, close, providing. Respond with reverence, wonder, awe.
    - If God created Life, then He alone gets to define it
    - Understanding is "standing under"
    
## Responsibility: We are faithful stewards of the many forms of God's grace.
    - Handle God's gifts well: life, abilities, resources, relationships, forgiveness. Managers not owners.

## Sanctification: People like us do things like this; as God's treasured possession, we life Jesus-like lives
    - Live in God-given identity and kingdom culture. Moved from darkness to kingdom. New identity: holy, beloved, forgiven. New culture: kingdom patterns.

## Imitation: We so love the world that we give our first and our best.
    - Love as God loves (John 3:16). Love enemies and difficult people. Give sacrificially.
    
## Influence: Our everyday story is for God's glory.
    -Daily life reveals God. Ambassadors everywhere: church, home, work, community. Work for others' welfare. Influence through prayer, authenticity, generosity, peace. A subtle, patient, pressure.
    
## "Fill everything in every way" (Eph. 1:23): Christ's comprehensive presence and authority, enacted through the Spirit and Church, permeating every place, person, and moment with his life, love, and lordship—directing how we show up and work in the world.

## In God's name: Baptizing in the Trinity's name immerses someone into God's very essence. Acting or praying in his name means bearing his reputation—living under his authority, within his family, wrapped in his identity and protection. Anything less is taking his name in vain.

## Childlike faith: Trust without pretense: open hands, honest questions, unguarded wonder. Knowing God relationally, believing he is who he says, receiving love unearned, depending on him as a child depends on a parent.

## Love the world?: Love "the world"? Depends on meaning. Neighbors—yes. Creation—yes. Anti-God systems—no. We love people not yet free in Christ, steward creation faithfully, and reject patterns that feed lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, and pride of life.

## Familiarity and Fluency: Christians learn to read worldly patterns—power, wealth, self-interest—without living by them, while growing fluent in Kingdom culture: faith through love, self-giving, enemy-love, dependence on God. Kingdom ways become native; we engage the world as wise, harmless ambassadors.

## On earth as in heaven: God wills his ways lived on earth as in heaven. This happens as his people are sanctified—set apart and transformed—living in gratitude. Through holy living and thankfulness, we become instruments of heaven's culture breaking into the present.

## Dignity: Every person bears the imago Dei—equal, unsurpassable dignity. Dehumanization denies this. Christ restores dignity by affirming worth, reconciling us to God, and calling us to honor all—even enemies—as beloved, deserving respect and compassion.

## Reconciliation: Reconciliation restores broken relationships. Christ's death and resurrection removed sin, making peace with God possible. The Church continues this ministry—healing divisions across every boundary that corrupts relationship with God, self, others, and creation.


# Key Definitions

## Eternal Life: Eternal life is knowing relationally the Father and the Son (John 17:3)

## Faith: Faith = trust + agency (freedom and action) + thresholds. Pledge yourself to the One you're coming to know—the Spirit and grace make this possible. Take the step! Faith waits at a threshold; a step crosses from known into not-yet-known. An upward spiral.

## Love: Love is the gift of self. Gift of obedience to God and for another's flourishing.

## Formation: Relationally embedding heaven's culture in disciple and church so it becomes normal pattern.

## Leadership: Work of compelling love from pure heart, good conscience, authentic faith by teaching and example (1 Tim 1:5).

## Justice: Righteousness. Making things right, working for shalom (right relationships). Includes rectification, restoration, reconciliation, renewal.

## Worship: A holistic self-giving response to glory. (Rom 12:1). Hint: Creator and created things have glory. Glory is the pure expression of a 'Thing's' intended being.

## Grace: The unmerited God-given desire, ability, and resources to participate in the Father's economy (purpose, plan, and activity) as His beloved.

## Devotion: A way of life in which we bring our whole selves to God and to others.

## Salvation: Trusting Jesus rescues and resettles us in God's kingdom—like emigrating, being reborn, or adopted. We gain new identity, citizenship, culture, and belonging. All things new.

## Authenticity and Transparency: Authenticity = being what one is meant to be. For humans: accurately carrying the identities of imagebearer, kingdom citizen, Christ's body member. Distinct from transparency, which is honest disclosure regardless of whether what's disclosed is authentic.

## Fear and Reverence: Biblical fear = awe-struck wonder at God's holiness, power, and goodness—not dread. It's recognizing God as Creator, Judge, Redeemer and responding with humility, worship, obedience. Reverence flows from God being both infinitely great and intimately near, worthy of highest honor and deepest trust.

## Culture: Culture = shared patterns, practices, stories, and values shaping how a group sees the world and lives together—"the way we do things around here." The assumptions, habits, and rhythms that normalize over time, forming a community's identity and direction.

## Truth: Truth has a name (John 14:6)
